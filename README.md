# wordcount-project
The Word Count Project aims to create a web application that allows users to enter text and receive a count of the number of words in the input. 
This project will be developed using Python and HTML programming languages.

The project will involve creating a user interface that allows users to input text, either by typing directly into the text field or by uploading a file. 
The application will then process the input text using Python code to count the number of words in the text.
The output will be displayed on the webpage in a user-friendly format.
